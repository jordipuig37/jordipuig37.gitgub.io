        This is the first post in my website, so this is meant to be both a test (I'm testing how does this works) and an introduction for the reader. This webpage is a professional profile, here I will post things I do related to Data Science and Engineering, professional information like my portfolio, CV and posts in a less formal style to express opinions related to the data and tech field.

        For those who don't know me I would like to present myself. I'm a Data Engineer based in Barcelona. I'm interested in data engineering, data analytics, artificial intelligence and virtually everything related to data. I also enjoy the low level side of big data management and cloud computing. I'm currently working as a Data Engineer consultant in Barcelona helping companies to build their data pipelines, data warehouses and dashboards. I have a bachelor's degree in Data Science and Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) and a MBA certificate from The Power MBA business school.

        I hope this serves as a personal and website presentation. I don't want to drag on and will save some content for other posts. That's all for now. If you need to contact me, feel free to email me or reach out to me through LinkedIn ;).
