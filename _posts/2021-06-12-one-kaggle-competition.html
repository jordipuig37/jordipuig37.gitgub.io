        Today I would like to share my personal experience and the work at InClass Kaggle competitions. The competition in question is [COVID-19 detection from coughs](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid), although I also participated in other InClass competitions. I loved to participate in this competition and here is why.

        The task at hand is something more or less usual, one could say, but has one particular characteristic that has been new for me: we have a small amount of data, meaning we can't train deep learning models from scratch and expect good results. Our professor gave us this task to work with some of the best pre-trained models in speech recognition. We could use 
        <a href="https://github.com/santi-pdp/pase" >PASE</a>, 
        <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2.html">wav2vec2</a> and 
        <a href="https://github.com/harritaylor/torchvggish">VGGish</a> 
        implementations to solve this. One note I have to make is that the teacher gave us working notebooks so we didn't had to start from scratch, this made all the process more easy and agile. The approach of my team was to select the feature extractor module from VGGish and train a model that classifies these features. If you want mode detail in the work done you can visit the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jordipuigrabat/vggish-validation">notebook</a> and download our report <a href="/assets/documents/onekagglecompetition.pdf" download >here</a>.

        I don't want to explain all the details here, I want to talk in a higher level about the experience. This competition –and the other InClass competitions from this same subject– has been the most motivating class homework, and most of the part is because of the competition mindset. Yes, I'm a competitive person and I like to give my best and try to win in competitions; although the competition score didn't directly affect your grade, for me is important to try to reach the podium. We were close to win this competition, we were on the first place during a week in the public test, and seconds the last days before finishing the competition. We ended up in the 4th place at the final private score. Although we didn't win, we got the feeling of doing something original and developing new ideas, which is –in my opinion– the point of Kaggle competitions. This is another reason why this assignment was motivating, because we had the freedom to think outside the box. We hadn't a clear direction to follow, we weren't limited by what is expected from us. We were asked to innovate and explore new possibilities to solve the task at hand.

        My final conclusion of this post is that Kaggle competitions are a great way to learn and have fun programming and training prediction models. Thanks for reading!
