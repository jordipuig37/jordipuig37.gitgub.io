    <h1> Welcome! </h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my personal website! My name is Jordi and I'm a data scientist passionate about machine learning. This blog work as a personal and professional directory where you can find information about me and my work.

    <h2> What can you find?</h2>
    <p>
        Although this page is still growing, my idea is to create a post section where I talk about various things, from a more personal perspective to a more professional and technical one. Moreover I want this page to work as a personal protfolio.
        Soon I will add more information!
        Also, if you want to see my work or my profile in other social network I have them all linked in the side bar.
