        This was my first job, so I began in a junior role and swiftly progressed to a mid-senior position. Throughout the first year, I primarily focused on a single project, which provided me with the opportunity to take on significant responsibilities. Initially, my manager handled client interactions and task assignments, but as time went on, I assumed these responsibilities myself. After less than a year, I could work autonomously, following the guidance of the client, who also served as the project manager.
