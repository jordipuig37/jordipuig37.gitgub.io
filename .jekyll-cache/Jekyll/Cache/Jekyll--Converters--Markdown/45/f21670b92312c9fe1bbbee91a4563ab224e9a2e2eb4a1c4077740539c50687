        This is the first post in my website, so this is meant to be both a test â€“I'm testing how does this worksâ€“ and an introduction for the reader. This webpage is a personal and professional profile, here I will post things I do related to Data Science, professional information like my portfolio, my CV and, why not, posts in a less formal style to express opinions or whatnot.
        <br />
        For those who don't know me I would like to present myself. I'm a <a href="https://dse.upc.edu/en">Data Science and Engineering</a> student at <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en?set_language=en">UPC</a>, in Barcelona. I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, Data Analysis and Data Science in general. I also like the more computational part of what I'm studying, like algorithmics and programming per se. I use python most of the time but I also know R, C++, SQL, <del>unfortunately</del> Matlab, learning HTML. I think when you have a general idea of what programming is, learning a new language is similar to learning a new python library.

        Aside from my interests related to my sudy field, I also want to add other things I enjoy to make it more personal. I always loved playing music, I play the saxophone and the guitar. I'm not a good singer but sometimes I play guitar and sing with friends. I also enjoy camping and hicking, either by the sea or by the mountain, what I like the most of this is the contact with nature.
